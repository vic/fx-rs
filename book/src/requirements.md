# Effect Requirements

In `fx-rs`, effect requirements are the types that must be present in the environment for an effect to be evaluated. Requirements can be provided in any order, and combinators exist to manipulate and discharge them.

See the subchapters for details on applying, shuffling, and providing requirements in Rust.

# Core Effects

The list of effects provided by `Fx.go` will increase as we see the need for them and as long as they provide useful on Golang programs.

Current Ideas for contributions:

- Resource management (reserve/use/release shared resources)
- Structured concurrency (instead of manually using mutex/channels)
- any other idea you find useful, [Issues and PRs](https://github.com/vic/fx.go) are welcome!
